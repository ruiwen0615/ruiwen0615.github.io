I am a Staff Software Engineer at Sensebrain, specializing in efficient image processing, computer vision algorithms, and software development on edge devices. 

I have over 15 years of research and professional experience in the field, with a focus on machine learning and deep learning models. My work spans data collection, network architecture design, training, testing, compression, quantization, and deployment.

I earned my PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University of Notre Dame, advised by Prof. Robert L. Stevenson. Before that, I completed my studies at Tongji University.

My research interests include computational photography, image restoration, and video processing.
