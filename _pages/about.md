I am an Imaging Software Engineer at Google, working on [Google Beam](https://beam.google.com/). I earned my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Robert L. Stevenson](https://www.nd.edu/~stevenson/). Before that, I completed my studies at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/).

I am generally interested in efficient image & video processing, computer vision algorithms, and software development on edge devices. 

I have over 15 years of research and professional experience in the field, with a focus on machine learning and deep learning models. My work spans data collection, network architecture design, training, testing, compression, quantization, and deployment.
